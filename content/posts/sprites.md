I'm still working through the vanilla AMOS bit of [my programming post]({{< ref "/posts/programming.md" >}}) but I'm very stuck at the moment on making sprites. I only need two- one for the space invaders and one for the ship (I think the little shields won't be sprites but dynamically generated, but we're getting to that).
