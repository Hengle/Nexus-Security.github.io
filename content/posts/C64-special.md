I bought a [mini C64](https://retrogames.biz/products/thec64-mini/) recently, I confess mainly because it comes with a joystick and I wanted one to play Sensi on my mini Amiga. Joysticks are not cheap and I think I picked up the C64 and the joystick for about £45 which means the C64 was effectively around £15. I have actually never in my life touched a real Commodore 64 and I have never played any games on one in any shape or form and so I thought it would be interesting to play them absolutely cold with no nostalgia. Sure, I love Alien Breed on the Amiga, but is that because I had fun playing it 30 years ago? This seemed like a good test. There is something like 64 games on there so I hardly think I'm going to play and write up all of them, so I'll go through alphabetically, play each one, and keep going with and write up the ones I find interesting.

To get me started, here is a complete list, which I will annotate as I go.

    * This is pretty good! It's like a cross between a top down racing game and a shoot 'em up. You can fly higher and lower to go below and above the obstacles, and make sure you collect the little "E"s because that gives you enough energy to complete the race. My only criticism so far is that it's not always easy to tell what you can fly over harmlessly and what will kill you, but actually with a bit of practice I pretty much got the hang of this
