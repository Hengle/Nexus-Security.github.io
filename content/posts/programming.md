If you read [my introduction]({{< ref "/posts/intro.md" >}}) then you'll know that part of the reason I'm doing this blog, doing any of this in fact, is because I tried to write Space Invaders in AMOS 25 years ago, got a weird bug, and gave up. More for my reference than anything else (like 95% of my GitHub, in fact), here follows a list of the options I've been looking at so far

There seem to be a few options. 

* AMOS (which comes in Easy and Professional form, as well as normal AMOS)
* BlitzBasic (which got to version 2 but now seems to have been upgraded to the related 3, [which looks pretty swish](https://www.amiblitz.de/index.php) with an IDE and everything)
* C (I would love to learn C but I gather it's pretty hard)
* Assembler (I've read Assembler and it looks like what most people think normal programming languages look like- gobbledigook)

I'm pretty much going to work down the list, I think, I'm going to go give BlitzBasic 3 a try, probably will bounce off that and then try C. But who knows? This is pretty fun, could end up anywhere. I highly doubt I will write a line of Amiga Assembler in my life but never say never.

One thing I should add is that I really want to write the code on an Amiga. An emulated one at the moment, and then perhaps I'll treat myself to a Vampire some time. I don't have much room in the office but Vampires are pretty small. I don't want to write games _for_ the Amiga, I want to write them _on_ the Amiga. You know, for old time's sake.

Next post is I think one aimed at my buddies, entitled, "So you want to play Amiga games without buying any new hardware?" (super easy and cheap).
