# Resources

I have been trying to catalogue things as I've found them but as I roam the internet looking for Amiga related stuff I'm finding so much stuff that I feel I need to start getting it all down in one place. I will continue to link stuff directly in posts where it's relevant, but I'm going to start compiling a mega list of links here. For now I'll just do a big list with subheadings but over time I might break it into several documents, see how it goes.

## Software

* [Loads of great downloads](https://www.amigapd.com/downloads.html) but do note that I can't actually figure out how to access this page from within the site which is not well organised- so I advise you to use this bookmark

## Programming

* [Online sprite editor](http://amigafonteditor.ozzyboshi.com/index_sprite.html) that outputs hex/ binary and a few other things ([and the code](https://github.com/Ozzyboshi/AmigaFontEditor))
* [Loads of source code for AMOS games](https://www.amigapd.com/amospdsourcecode.html)
* [AMOS public domain CD](https://archive.org/details/cdrom-amospdcd)
