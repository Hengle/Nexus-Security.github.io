I'm Chris Beeley and I'm a data scientist. You can find [my GitHub here](https://github.com/ChrisBeeley) and [my team's GitHub here](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team). 

I've returned to the Amiga after a long absence and will be explaining the modern Amiga scene (to the best of my ability) and chronicling my quest to write Space Invaders in AMOS (Amiga BASIC, essentially).

Come say [hi on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisBeeley/) if you like, if you like Amigas I'm sure we'll get on great, or even if you don't come say hi anyway.
